Sure! Here's the updated version with each answer in 4 simple lines:

1. Basics of Machine Learning


1. What is Linear Regression?
It draws the best straight line through data.
Used to predict numbers like sales or prices.
It finds the relationship between variables.
Good for simple prediction problems.

2. What is a Deep Neural Network?
A model with many connected layers.
Each layer learns different features.
Used for images, speech, and text.
Learns complex patterns in data.

3. What is the concept of Standardization?
It changes data to a standard scale.
Mean becomes 0, standard deviation is 1.
Helps model learn faster and better.
Often used before training models.

4. Why split data into train and test?
Training data builds the model.
Testing data checks model accuracy.
Prevents overfitting to training data.
Helps test model on unseen cases.

5. Application of Deep Neural Network
Used in face and speech recognition.
Powers self-driving and recommendation systems.
Used in healthcare and fraud detection.
Helps in translating languages too.

2. Classification Concepts




1. What is Binary Classification?
It classifies data into two groups.
Examples: true/false, yes/no, spam/not spam.
Used in medical, email, and finance.
Only two outputs are possible.

2. What is Binary Cross Entropy?
It measures how wrong predictions are.
Used in binary classification tasks.
Lower value means better model.
Helps improve model accuracy.

3. What is Validation Split?
A portion of training data is set aside.
Used to check model during training.
Helps tune parameters like learning rate.
Prevents overfitting to training data.

4. What is the Epoch Cycle?
One complete pass through training data.
More epochs can improve learning.
Too many may cause overfitting.
Used in deep learning training.

5. What is Adam Optimizer?
An optimizer to adjust model weights.
It combines features of other optimizers.
Works well on most deep models.
Helps train faster and better.

3. Neural Network Functions
1. What is Batch Size?
Number of samples processed at once.
Used during model training.
Smaller batch = more updates.
Affects speed and memory use.

2. What is Dropout?
It randomly turns off neurons during training.
Helps prevent overfitting.
Makes model more general.
Common in deep learning models.

3. What is RMSprop?
An optimizer that adjusts learning rate.
Remembers recent changes in weights.
Used in recurrent networks and deep learning.
Improves training stability.

4. What is the Softmax Function?
Converts numbers into probabilities.
All outputs add up to 1.
Used in multi-class classification.
Chooses the class with highest score.

5. What is the ReLU Function?
ReLU stands for Rectified Linear Unit.
Keeps positive values, sets negatives to zero.
Speeds up training of deep networks.
Common in hidden layers.

4. Data Understanding & CNN



1. What is Exploratory Analysis?
It’s the first step to study data.
Involves visualizing and summarizing data.
Helps find patterns, trends, and errors.
Guides further data processing.

2. What is Correlation Matrix?
Shows how features relate to each other.
Values from -1 to +1.
High value means strong relationship.
Helps in selecting useful features.

3. What is Conv2D used for?
Used in CNNs to process images.
Finds patterns like edges or textures.
Applies filters over image pixels.
Used for feature extraction in vision.

5. MNIST Dataset
1. What is MNIST dataset for classification?
Contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits.
Each image is 28x28 pixels.
Used to train models to recognize numbers.
Popular for beginner deep learning tasks.

2. How many classes are in MNIST dataset?
It has 10 classes from 0 to 9.
Each image is labeled with a digit.
Used for multi-class classification.
Every digit is one unique class.

3. What is 784 in MNIST dataset?
Each image is 28×28 = 784 pixels.
Flattened into a 1D array.
Each pixel is a feature.
Input size for models is 784.

4. How many epochs are there in MNIST?
Depends on the training setup.
Common values: 5 to 20 epochs.
More epochs help learning.
But too many can overfit.

5. What are the hardest digits in MNIST?
Digits like 5 and 8 can be hard.
They often look similar to 3 or 9.
Bad handwriting makes it harder.
Causes more classification mistakes.

6. What is CNN?
CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network.
Used for image and video tasks.
Finds patterns like shapes and edges.
Great for computer vision problems.

You said:
What is model weights
What under fitting and over fitting 

What are Model Weights?
Model weights are numbers the model learns.
They decide how much each input matters.
Weights are updated during training.
They help make accurate predictions.

What is Underfitting?
Underfitting happens when a model is too simple.
It can't learn patterns from training data well.
Both training and test errors are high.
The model needs more complexity or features.

What is Overfitting?
Overfitting happens when a model learns too much.
It memorizes training data, even noise.
Training error is low, but test error is high.
The model doesn’t perform well on new data.
